To make a list we can use the following

* This is item one
* This is item two 
    * This is a subpoint in the list
        
        *This is also another subpoint

- This is another list
- We can use dashes instead of *s

1. This is item one
2. This is item two
    - This is a _subpoint_ under two
4. This is item three

# Blockquote

These are usually used to show quote, things that someone has said.

It's useful to give emphasis to a collection of lines.
